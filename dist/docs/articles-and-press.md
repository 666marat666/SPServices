Many people are actively using SPServices, and I wanted to start collecting some of the writing about their experiences here. A simple Bing or Google search for SPServices will turn up all sorts of things, but these links are the ones which I feel will be especially useful for others. If you have written something about SPServices which you'd like me to include here, please [let me know](https://www.codeplex.com/site/users/contact/sympmarc). Thanks to Jim Bob Howard for the idea for this page.
